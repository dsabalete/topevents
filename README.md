# Tercer Espai - Nuxt 3

This is a Nuxt 3 project for the Tercer Espai website. It is a simple website that provides information about the Tercer Espai, a community space in Barcelona that offers a variety of activities and services. The website includes information about several spaces where video and graphic art events are performed, information about each of them, its schedule... It also provides a contact form for users to get in touch with the Tercer Espai team and a newsletter signup form in order to get regular notifications about new events.

The website is built using Nuxt 3, Vue 3, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to be responsive and accessible.
